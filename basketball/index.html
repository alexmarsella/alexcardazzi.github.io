        <p>The Days Between Contracts</p>
             <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NBA players sign contracts worth a lot of money relative to us mortals. As an outlier example, LeBron James was paid $35 million in 2019 by the Lakers.

	      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Super niche <a href="https://twitter.com/bball_ref?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bball_ref</a> thread: I am looking at some game logs for players and finding some inconsistencies. For example, Alvan Adams is reported to have obtained 157 ORB and 389 DRB in the 1980-81 season. However, there was a single game where O/DRB were not recorded.</p>&mdash; alex cardazzi (@ACardazzi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ACardazzi/status/1295438214254268417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>Are NBA Players Lying About Their Weights?<p>
	      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A lot of NBA players lie about their height. In the beginning of the 2019-20 NBA season, the NBA standardized how they measure player heights. Here are yearly height changes since the 1997-98 NBA season. This went from under 20 changes per year to about 250 in one season. <a href="https://t.co/77QPajhclj">pic.twitter.com/77QPajhclj</a></p>&mdash; alex cardazzi (@ACardazzi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ACardazzi/status/1266888980508925953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>The Explosion of the Woj Bomb</p>
	      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there a single Twitter notification more exciting than a Woj Bomb in early July? Perhaps you care more about the barrage in February, but July is when NBA free agency (usually) begins. As mere mortals, Woj is our best glimpse inside the offices of GMs across the NBA.</p>&mdash; alex cardazzi (@ACardazzi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ACardazzi/status/1240265543632015371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

	      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Recently, there have been a lot of players who have changed their numbers in honor of Kobe Bryant.

	      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For Wilt&#39;s last 7 seasons, you can play this cool game where someone says his rebounding and scoring averages for the year and someone else has to guess which is which. Specifically, in 1966-67, he had nearly identical averages of 24.2 and 24.1. <a href="https://t.co/QvLFFE8HSN">pic.twitter.com/QvLFFE8HSN</a></p>&mdash; alex cardazzi (@ACardazzi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ACardazzi/status/1201186848569266177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Here&#39;s a plot (data from 2000-2020) showing the &quot;gravity&quot; he has on the glass.
